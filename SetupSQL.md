## Prepare your SQL Server Installation
-------------------------------------------

The rest of this page assumes you are configuring your on premises SQL Server 2016 or higher for this solution.

If you need a trial version of SQL Server 2016, see [What's New in SQL Server 2016](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb500435.aspx) for download or VM options. 

For more information about SQL server 2017 and R service, please visit: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt604847.aspx">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt604847.asp</a>

Complete the steps in the Set up SQL Server R Services (In-Database) Instructions. The set up instructions file can found at  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt696069.aspx" target="_blank"> https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt696069.aspx</a>


## Ready to Run Code 
---------------------

You are now ready to run the code for this solution.  

* Typically a data scientist will create and test a predictive model from their favorite R IDE, at which point the models will be stored in SQL Server and then scored in production using Transact-SQL (T-SQL) stored procedures. 
You can follow along with this by following the <a href="Typical.html">Typical Workflow.</a>.

* If youâ€™re just interested in the outcomes of this process, we have created a fully automated solution that loads the data in the database, trains and scores the models and provides recommendations by executing a PowerShell script. This is the fastest way to deploy to your on-prem server. See <a href="Powershell_Instructions.html">PowerShell Instructions</a> for this deployment.
