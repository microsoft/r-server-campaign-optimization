## Step 4: Deploy and Visualize with Bernie the Business Analyst 
----------------------------------------------------------------

Now that the predictions are created and the recommendations have been saved, we will meet our last persona - Bernie, the Business Analyst. Bernie will use the Power BI Dashboard to learn more about the recommendations (second tab). He will also review summaries of the data used to create the model (first tab).  While both tabs contain information about Day of Week, Time of Day, and Channel, it is important to understand that on the Recommendations tab this refers to predicted recommendations to use in the future, while on the Summaries tab these values refer to historical data used to create the prediction model that provided the recommendations.  

Bernie will then let the Campaign Team know that they are ready for their next campaign rollout - the data in the `Recommendations` table contains the recommended time and channel for each lead in the campaign.  The team uses these recommendations to contact leads in the new campaign.

*Remember that before the data in this dashboard can be refreshed to use your scored data, you must <a href="Visualize_Results.html">configure the dashboard</a> as Debra did in step 2 of this workflow.*
